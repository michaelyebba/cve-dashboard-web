# TOP 10 CVE Dashboard Web Application
This is an application written in React that displays a list of the 10 most recent Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) for 3 different severities (HIGH, MEDIUM, and LOW) in tabular form. It also allows users to search by product name.  These vulnerabilities were obtained from the [National Vulnerability Database's](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds) data feeds.  The data feeds were downloaded and subsequently scrubbed using Elasticsearch and a REST service layer written in Spring Boot.

## What does this application do?
The current features include:
* List top 10 most recent CVEs.
* List top 10 most recent HIGH severity CVEs.
* List top 10 most recent MEDIUM severity CVEs.
* List top 10 most recent LOW severity CVEs.
* Product search to view the top 10 most recent CVEs containing the supplied product name.
* CVE detail screen to view full description and full list of impacted products.

Currently the application only shows a list of top 10 CVEs.  However, the corresponding REST API developed for this web application allows full searching and view of all CVE records in 2019.
Future enhancements include:
* Provide user the ability to customize result size and implement pagination of large result sets
* Provide flat file export capability

## Why was this application built?
### Reason #1 - Demonstrate Integration of a React web application with Spring Boot REST API
The reason for building this application is to demonstrate how to build a React web application that integrates with the [CVE Dashboard REST service layer](https://github.com/michaelyebba/cve-dashboard-service/) developed using Spring Boot Web MVC. Please see additional documentation on how to set up the REST API.

### Reason #2 - Demonstrate CI/CD Integration with TravisCI
Additionally, this application demonstrates how to integrate with TravisCI to report on any build failures as well as deploy continuously to GitHub pages.  Click here to [View this project's CI/CD Pipeline](https://travis-ci.com/michaelyebba/cve-dashboard-web/).  For more information, view [.travis.yml](https://github.com/michaelyebba/cve-dashboard-web/blob/master/.travis.yml) in the root directory of this project.

## Additional Notes
There are no project dependencies for this app since it is currently consuming the REST API deployed to Heroku.  However, you are encouraged to download and get the [CVE Dashboard Service layer](https://github.com/michaelyebba/cve-dashboard-service/) running locally as well.  Please view that project's Readme.md file to learn how to do that as well as view documentation for the REST endpoint URLs.
